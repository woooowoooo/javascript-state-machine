# Javascript State Machine
Personal fork of [Jake Gordon's Javascript State Machine](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine/), a library for finite state machines.

The first iteration of this fork was just me exploring the library and removing the surprising amount of webpack bloat I found (2021-12-26). Along the way I did some modernization, like updating `for` loops to `for in` and `for of` and adding classes (2022-01-07). I finally created this fork and formalized this updating process, which is why this repository starts later than my first use of the modified library (2022-01-08).

The built (without webpack and its bloat) module can be accessed at [module.js](module.js).
